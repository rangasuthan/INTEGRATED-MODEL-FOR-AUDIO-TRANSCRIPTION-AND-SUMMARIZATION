# SpeechSift: Integrated Model for Audio Transcription and Summarization  


SpeechSift is an advanced AI-driven solution that transcribes and summarizes audio recordings with high accuracy. Designed to handle multiple languages and potentially dialects, SpeechSift aims to simplify information extraction from audio, making it accessible and actionable for everyone.

## Features  
- **Accurate Transcription**: Converts speech into text efficiently.  
- **Concise Summarization**: Generates meaningful summaries of audio content.  
- **Multilingual Support**: Processes a variety of languages and is adaptable to dialect-specific transcription.  
- **Custom Output**: Supports flexible summarization formats (e.g., key points, narratives).  
- **Future-Ready**: Real-time processing and feedback integration planned.

## How It Works  
SpeechSift integrates cutting-edge models for transcription and summarization:  
1. **Transcription**: Powered by AssemblyAI's state-of-the-art ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) API.  
2. **Summarization**: Utilizes Hugging Face transformers for summarization, ensuring precise and context-aware outputs.
